## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.1] - 2018-01-17

### Changed

* Renamed type variables from `selection` to `decodesTo` for clarity.
* Updated code generation to use type and module name `Field` rather than `FieldDecoder` for elm package version 7.0.0.

## [2.1.0] - 2018-01-13

### Fixed

* Single-letter names no longer cause exceptions (like `x` or `y`).

### Changed

* Update name normalization strategy to make only the minimal change to make a name valid
  (that is, put leading underscores at the tail, and make sure the first letter is the correct case).
  Unless it is ALL_UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE_SEPARATED_NAME, then make it ClassCase.

## [2.0.3] - 2018-01-13

### Added

* Generate metadata json file with target elm package version and npm package version.

### Removed

* Remove npm version number and target elm package version number from comments
  on generated modules to reduce diff noise in future updates.

### Fixed

* Fixed error on windows related to shelling out.

### Removed

* Stopped generating unnecessary InputObject type definitions file.

## [2.0.1] - 2018-01-10

### Added

* Add `--output` flag to command line to choose a directory
  other than `./src` for generated output

## [2.0.0] - 2018-01-10

### Added

* Generate Scalars module with type definitions/constructors for each custom scalar.

  the result of the introspection query. This may change in the future.

## [1.0.1] - 2018-01-08

### Added
